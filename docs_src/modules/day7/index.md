# Day 7: Advanced Nextflow, Version Control with GitHub & Real Genomics Applications

**Date**: September 9, 2025
**Duration**: 09:00-13:00 CAT
**Focus**: Version control, containerization, and production-ready MTB analysis pipelines

## Learning Philosophy: Build → Version → Containerize → Deploy → Collaborate

Building on Exercise 3 from Day 6, this module transforms your basic pipeline into a professional, production-ready workflow:

- **Build**: Extend your Exercise 3 pipeline with advanced features
- **Version**: Track changes and collaborate using Git and GitHub
- **Containerize**: Package tools using Docker for reproducibility
- **Deploy**: Run pipelines reliably across different environments
- **Collaborate**: Share and maintain pipelines as a team
