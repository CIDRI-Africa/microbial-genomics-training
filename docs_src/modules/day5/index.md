## Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise 1: First Nextflow Script (30 minutes)
Create and run a simple Nextflow pipeline.

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

// Define parameters
params.input = "data/*.fastq"
params.outdir = "results"

// Create a channel from input files
Channel
    .fromPath(params.input)
    .set { fastq_ch }

// Define a process
process countReads {
    input:
    path fastq from fastq_ch
    
    output:
    path "*.count" into counts_ch
    
    script:
    """
    echo "Processing ${fastq}"
    wc -l ${fastq} > ${fastq.baseName}.count
    """
}

// View the results
counts_ch.view()
```

### Exercise 2: Building a QC Pipeline (60 minutes)
Implement quality control with FastQC and MultiQC.

```groovy
process fastqc {
    container 'biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9'
    
    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), path(reads)
    
    output:
    path "*_fastqc.{zip,html}" into fastqc_results
    
    script:
    """
    fastqc -t ${task.cpus} ${reads}
    """
}

process multiqc {
    publishDir params.outdir, mode: 'copy'
    container 'ewels/multiqc:latest'
    
    input:
    path '*' from fastqc_results.collect()
    
    output:
    path 'multiqc_report.html'
    
    script:
    """
    multiqc .
    """
}
```

### Exercise 3: Integrating Assembly (90 minutes)
Add genome assembly to the pipeline.

```groovy
process spades_assembly {
    container 'staphb/spades:latest'
    cpus 4
    memory '8 GB'
    
    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), path(reads1), path(reads2)
    
    output:
    tuple val(sample_id), path("${sample_id}_contigs.fasta")
    
    script:
    """
    spades.py \
        -1 ${reads1} \
        -2 ${reads2} \
        -o spades_output \
        -t ${task.cpus} \
        --careful
    
    cp spades_output/contigs.fasta ${sample_id}_contigs.fasta
    """
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Workflow Principles
- **Reproducibility**: Same input â†’ same output
- **Portability**: Run anywhere (laptop, HPC, cloud)
- **Scalability**: Handle any data volume
- **Resumability**: Restart from failure points

### Nextflow Components
| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Process | Computational step | `process fastqc { ... }` |
| Channel | Data flow connection | `Channel.fromPath()` |
| Operator | Channel transformation | `.map()`, `.filter()` |
| Directive | Process configuration | `cpus 4` |

### Best Practices
1. **Use containers**: Ensure environment reproducibility
2. **Parameterize everything**: Make pipelines flexible
3. **Version control**: Track pipeline changes
4. **Document thoroughly**: Help users and future self
5. **Test incrementally**: Build and test step by step

## Assessment Activities

### Individual Tasks
- Create a basic Nextflow script with at least 2 processes
- Successfully run a pipeline with test data
- Modify pipeline parameters and observe changes
- Debug a pipeline with intentional errors
- Document pipeline usage

### Group Discussion
- Compare Nextflow with traditional shell scripting
- Discuss reproducibility challenges and solutions
- Share pipeline design strategies
- Explore nf-core pipeline catalog

## Common Challenges

### Installation Issues
```bash
# Install Nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
./nextflow run hello

# Set up environment
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD
export NXF_VER=23.10.0
```

### Channel Operations
```groovy
// Common channel patterns
Channel
    .fromFilePairs(params.reads)
    .ifEmpty { error "No read files found!" }
    .set { read_pairs_ch }

// Combining channels
fastqc_ch
    .join(assembly_ch)
    .map { sample, qc, assembly -> 
        [sample, qc, assembly]
    }
```

### Resource Management
```groovy
process memory_intensive {
    memory { 2.GB * task.attempt }
    maxRetries 3
    errorStrategy 'retry'
    
    script:
    """
    # Your command here
    """
}
```
